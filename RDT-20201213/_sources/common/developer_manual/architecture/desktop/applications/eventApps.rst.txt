Event Applications
==================

The **event application** takes the event(s) selected for a building site, associates each one with a simulation, and creates EVENT files containing the event intensity measures. It obtains the name of the event from the :ref:`BIM file <lblBuildingApp>` and the intensity measure information from the input :ref:`event files <lblUserDefInputs>`.
This input information is saved in an "EVENT.json" file, located in its corresponding **simulation working directory**.
