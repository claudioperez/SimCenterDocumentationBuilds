Backend Applications
*********************

.. This section broadly applies to all of the SimCenter's computational applications - quoFEM, EE-UQ, WE-UQ, Hydro-UQ, PBE, and RDT - which are run on a standardized workflow composed of the same set of backend applications.

The backend applications are categorized by function into the following workflow |term1| which create and populate *intermediate files* used to propagate information from one component application to the next. The component applications and their intermediate files are as follows:

.. .. |term1| replace:: SoftTech Analyzer

.. |term1| replace:: modules

#. :ref:`Building Applications <lblBuildingApp>` - create the BIM files for every building asset, containing building properties.
#. :ref:`Regional Mapping Applications <lblRegionalMapApp>` - map an intensity measure (IM) or time series for the hazard event to each building asset site.
#. :ref:`Event Applications <lblEventApp>` - create the EVENT files for every building asset, containing loads corresponding to the hazard event(s).
#. :ref:`Modeling Applications <lblmodelingApp>` - create the Structural Analysis Model (SAM) files for every building asset, containing structural model parameters.
#. :ref:`Engineering Demand Parameter (EDP) Applications <lblEDPApp>` - create the EDP files for every building asset, containing expected response outputs of the structural model.
#. :ref:`Simulation (SIM) Applications <lblSimulationApp>` - create the SIM files for every building asset, containing analysis settings for response simulation.
#. :ref:`Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) Applications <lblUQApp>` - execute all steps in the workflow, with the option to quantify uncertainty with experiments using random variables.
#. :ref:`Damage and Loss (DL) Applications <lblDLApp>` - estimate expected damages and losses from the EDP application's output.

These applications make up the "backbone" of SimCenter workflow systems, with each one calling on a different subset of the component applications. 

.. The component applications corresponding to each SimCenter workflow system is illustrated in :numref:`figFramework`.
