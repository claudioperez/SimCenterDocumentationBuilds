Source Code
***********

The OpenSees source code is available to obtain from the |githubLink|. GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.

.. note::

   If you plan on collaborating or even using OpenSees as your base code it is highly recommended that you FORK this repo to your own account and work on it there. We will not allow anybody to push to the |githubLink|.


.. warning::

   Only PULL requests from your FORK to the main repo will be considered **AND** they will only be considered if there are **NO CONFLICTS**. 

   Pull requests which cause **CONFLICTS** will be rejected out of hand as we have no time to reconcile them.
   
   We strongly encourage you to get in the habit of keeping your FORK in synch with the main OpenSees repo on a regular basis to avoid said conflicts. This requires you to **merge** or rebase.

* This is not the place to come for instruction on how to use github. 

* To fork the repo click on the FORK at the top right of the |githubLink|. 

* For a brief outline on forking we suggest the `Atlassians forking workflow page <https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/forking-workflow>`_.

* For a brief introduction to using your new FORK we suggest the `Atlassians saving changes <https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/saving-changes>`_.

* For those interested in programming, you might as well become proficient using git so the link to all of `Atlassians git tutorial <https://www.atlassian.com/git>`_ will make help.
